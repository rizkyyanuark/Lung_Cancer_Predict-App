# 🫁 Lung Cancer Predict

## 📝 Overview

The Lung-Cancer Predict project is an innovative app with a graphical user interface (GUI) that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the risk level of lung cancer in patients. The user can input relevant medical data, and the machine learning model will analyze the information to provide a detailed risk assessment.

## ✨ Features

- 🔮 Predict Cancer Risk: Input patient data and let the machine learning model predict the lung cancer risk level.
- ⏳ Patient Queue Priority: Manage patient appointments efficiently with a queue priority system based on urgency.
- 📊 Patient Count Graph: View a real-time graph displaying the number of patients for easy tracking and analysis.
- 🎨 Simple UI: Navigate easily with a clean, user-friendly interface designed for smooth operation.
- 🌙 Dark Mode: Enable dark mode for a comfortable user experience during long working hours.
